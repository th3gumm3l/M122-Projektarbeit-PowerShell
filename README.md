# M122-Projektarbeit-PowerShell

## üìúAssignment

1. You are to implement a simple backup solution of a defined number of directories and files in Powershell (see below for more detailed specifications). 
2. The backup should be a copy of the corresponding directories and files. 
3. A log (e.g. log file) should be created and saved when the backup is created. 
4. After completion of the backup, it should be possible to check whether the backup was correct and complete by checking the number of copied objects (directories and files). 
   This check should be defined as a test case and its result presented in the report. 
5. No "third party components" (such as backup tools) may be used. 
6. If you want to use Bash instead of Powershell, please consult the teacher. 

### üìùAs a result of the application work, the following should be produced (report) 
1. Powershell script (one or more executable PS files), with the solution implementation as code 
2. PAP showing the process of their solution 
3. Log of backup execution (can be log file) 
4. Description of test cases for their solution, demonstrating correct operation; the description of the test cases must also include the expected result and the test data used for each test case. 
5. Execution of test cases, presentation of test results (sufficiently detailed). 

## üìúTimelines and submissions (final and intermediate submissions), video
1. Non-compliance with timelines (submissions and intermediate submissions) will result in a mark deduction.
2. In addition to the report, a video (3 min.) on their solution to their application work must be submitted, in which they present and explain selected chapters from the report. The explanation in the video (oral commentary on the video) has to be done in equal parts by the group members (e.g. by showing a backup sequence or a test case and giving oral explanations). 

## üìúDefault for report: Document to be submitted 
They are to file their work results in an AA report* in Word (submission as PDF).
This report should contain (structure the content of your AA report according to this structure):

1. Title page (group name, group members, date, version information)
2. Order, describe the order as you understand it in your implementation (approx. pages)
3. Description of the effectively used structure of directories and files.
   PAR describing the design of your solution (approx. 1 page), with text explaining the PAP
4. 2 - 3 test cases you plan to use, and the expected results per test case
   (Overview of the test cases in a table incl. expected result, and incl. test data/parameters Minimum size of the table: approx. 1 page; size of the more detailed description of the test cases as required)
5. Short description of how the PS code is to be used or how a backup with the implementation is to be 
6. To be carried out, i.e. which functions are to be called and how, in order to carry out the backup (0.5 - 1 page) Possibly: Execution and results (e.g. a log file) of the tests; an explanation of the results of the test is also good. 
7. Conclusion on your application work (how do you judge your solution) (approx. pages)
8. Powershell scripts as an attachment
9. Log file of a successful backup as attachment 2 
10. Documentation concept as attachment 3
